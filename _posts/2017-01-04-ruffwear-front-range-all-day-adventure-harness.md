A handsome harness for your doggo!  But don't let the good looks fool you, this isn't a harness designed for fashion. Designed with quality materials and built to go the distance.  From city park to mountain peak, the folks at Ruffwear want to make sure your pup stays and comfortable wherever life takes you.


## Bright and Bold

Bold colors help your dog stand out.  Maybe that means tracking them down in a big, off-leash dog park or winning the affection of passersby on your routine walks.  Either way you and your dog will appreciate the good looks of this harness.  It also comes with excellent reflective material to increase visibility at night no matter what bright color you choose.  This is an incredibly important safety feature in urban areas where dog's need to excercise and light is low. There is good top and side coverage of reflective material.

## Pull No More

The Adventure harness comes equipped with two sturdy leash attachment points.  An alumnium ring on the dog's back is a great choice for trained dogs.  Sidewalk to trail, the leash is securely attached to your harness and provides them with the most comfort and freedom.  If your pooch tends to pull on the leash while you walk, the ring on the chest part of the harness will help discourage your dog from tugging so hard.  This also great for when you are in crowded areas or other situations where you need enhanced control of your dog.  The dog is more likely to walk next to or behind you when the leash is attached to the front.

## Lost and Found

A pouch to hold any ID information or tags is discreetly built right in to the Adventure harness. If your dog ever gets away from you while wearing their harness, who ever finds them will know how to address your dog and get in touch with you immediately.  Sometimes an excited dog can take off down the trail, be prepared just in case and have them carry a trip itenerary.
