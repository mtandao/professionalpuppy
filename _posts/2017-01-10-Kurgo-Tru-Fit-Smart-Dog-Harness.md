True to its name, this harness is highly adjustable to fit your dog just right. There are two main loops to adjust: the front collar, and the back loop.  The front collar should fit like any other dog collar you have used before. What is more unique about this harness is that the front collar is adjusted on either side of the dog's neck, not just in one location.  This may seem redundant but it allows for a sturdier design of the harness.  The back loop is adjustable with the same controls as the front collar, on both the left and right side of the rib cage.  Adjusting the rear loop to your particular dog's girth is important.  The loop should go around your pet's rib cage and the fit should be fairly snug.  Be careful not to overtighten this strap as it may be uncomfortable for the dog, but make sure to adjust it tight enough so the harness does slip or slide while walking.


## Thou Shall Not Pull 

If your dog tugs on leash then you'll love these important Tru-Fit Smart Dog Walking Harness features:


1. Padded chest pannel

   This ensures your dog's safety when she starts pulling.  With a convential leash-collar tether, pulling can damage a dog's throat or neck or cause difficulty breathing.  With the Tru-Fit's broad, padded chest pannel the force of your excited dog is distributed across the entire chest.  This is also the most comfortable option for your dog.


2. Front leash-attachment point

   The ring on the front of the Tru-Fit dog harness discourages pulling.  When the leash is secured in this position the dog is more inclined to walk next to or behind you.  Now you can both enjoy your neighborhood walks!


## Conclusion: Great Buy

Can't go wrong with this harness.
