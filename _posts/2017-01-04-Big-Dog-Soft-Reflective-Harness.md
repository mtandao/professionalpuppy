Does your 75lb puppy like to take you on walks around the neighborhood?  While every dog should be trained to walk properly on a leash, a harness can help you safely manage a large dog that may get over excited or pull on the leash. Running to the end of the leash and difficulty breathing while pulling on the leash are signs you should use a harness to walk your dog to protect the sensitve organs in their neck.


## A Handler's Handle

A strong handle is attached to the harness and positioned directly on top of the dog's shoulders.  Should your pooch get over excited the handle will allow to keep a strong grasp and help to restrain your dog.  This is also convenient for training your dog or situations where you need enhanced control of your dog, like the vet office or groomers.


## Reflective Stripe

This is great for city dwelling dogs who need to get outside after dark.  Reflective bands are an important safety feature if you live in an area that requires walking your dog at night.  This harness has moderate coverage of reflective material, there is one thick band going across the top of the harness.


## Conclusion: Good Budget Friendly Option

This is a cheaper harness and it will not last as many years as some of the higher-priced harnesses. It is not as adjustable and may not be the right choice if your dog is a strong puller.  That said, this is an excellent choice for a first harness for the price.  It will let you and your dog practice walking on a harness and without worrying about it being destroyed by chewing or otherwise.  Then when you are ready you can upgrade to the right harness for you and your dog's individual needs.
