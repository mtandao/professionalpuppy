## Best of Breed Dog Harnesses

These dog harnesses are recommended as safe and effective tools to manage your dog while walking on leash.

### Sizing

In general, any dog walking harness you purchase should come with specific sizing information.  It is best to follow their instructions for fitting your harness.  A proper fit is important for the dog's harnesss to work correctly and for the dog to stay securely tethered to the leash.

Improper fit can manifest in the following problems:

 * harness slips off
 * pulling even with a no-pull harness
 * dog trips on leash
 * dog bites on leash or harness
 * dog refuses to walk while wearing harness

If your pooch has any of these issues, have no fear!  Most of them are easily resolved by simply adjusting the plastic buckles, usually ladder lock style buckles like those used on backpacks.  The trick to making a strap looser or tighter is to push the strap through from one side then pull the slack through the buckle from the other side.

Sometimes the strap can come all the way out of the buckle and needs to be threaded back through.  Check out how to thread a back pack strap on [howjunction](http://www.howjunction.com/how-to-thread-a-back-pack-strap.html) for tips.


If you are having trouble deciding which size harness to buy use this rule of thumb:

| Small | 1-29 lbs |
| Medium | 30-49 lbs |
| Large | 50+ lbs |
