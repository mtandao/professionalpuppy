## Dog Crates

Dogs are naturally inclined to sleeping in crates because of their ancestors den animals.  Once properly trained, a kennel is a safe and comfortable place for your dog to spend up to a *few* hours alone.

Covering the sides of wire crates with a blanket may make the dog more comfortable, as it emulates a more natural underground den.  However, make sure the dog can still see out from their crate or they will actually feel more uncomfortable than with no blanket at all.
